## The Problem

Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (‘SMEs’) are critical to Australia’s economy as they make up 90% of all businesses. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, SMEs have been particularly affected due to store closures and reduced demand. 30% of businesses had to reduce staff numbers and 9 out of 10 businesses expressed solvency concerns over the next 4-6 months. Through our engagement with local businesses, we discovered that the major pain point was not the lack of governmental support, but the ineffective communication channels. Business owners have not been able to access the full breadth of support because information on different fiscal relief programs was scattered across multiple websites, making it prone for businesses to miss out. To determine their eligibility, applicants had to further spend countless hours perusing through documentations of each program. Finally, businesses were not alerted promptly when there were any updates to government policies. 

Recent second wave outbreaks in Melbourne and other cities around the world make clear that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to be an ongoing uncertainty for businesses and the economy. 

## "Business Buddy"

Business Buddy aims to tackle this issue and provide robust support to SMEs during the COVID-19 pandemic, acting as a one-stop-shop for SMEs to gain insight of all their eligible grants and loans. The platform has two distinct elements, ‘My Buddy’ (a chatbot) and ‘My Services’ (a virtual pin-board with useful links, tailored to the business).

After SMEs sign up onto our platform, they will first be prompted to input key information about their business. This will allow ‘My Buddy’ to make a preliminary determination of their eligibility to various governmental programs,, based on their profile. From here, My Buddy guides the business to make a more conclusive determination by assessing the business against specific eligibility requirements. If a business is deemed to be eligible, they will be able to pin this to My Services for easy access to the application portal. Finally, it is also worth mentioning that if a business logs back into the platform at a future date, My Buddy will assess the business against new programs that have been introduced by the government. 

In addition to grant and loan assessment, My Buddy provides notifications of COVID-19 updates. This bridges the communication gap between the Australian government and SMEs, providing businesses with greater levels of operational certainty. 

## Competitiveness

Business Buddy meets an unmet need of SMEs by enhancing the communication channel between existing Australian governmental websites and small businesses. Instead of having to forage through governmental websites and assess eligibility of each program separately, Business Buddy delivers personalised information straight to the user. As Business Buddy is a simple and flexible code, it can be scaled and transferred to a range of global governments. 
Finally, because Business Buddy is accessible online and is powered by Artificial Intelligence (IBM Watson Assistant), it is a quicker and more cost effective solution compared to traditional financial advisory services.
