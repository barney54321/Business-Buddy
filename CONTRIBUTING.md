### How to Contribute in Issues

There are multiple ways you can contribute to the project:

1. By opening a new issue if you find a bug: For example, if you find that the
   styling for one of the pages does not work with certain resolutions, or have
   identified a potential security flaw, create a new issue.
2. By opening a new issue if you come up with a beneficial enhancement: For
   example, if you believe that you have a good Service that can be added to 
   the My Services tab, create a new issue with the "enhancement" tag.
3. By helping triage an issue: This can be done either by providing
   supporting details (a test case that demonstrates a bug), or providing
   suggestions on how to address the issue.
4. By helping resolve an issue: Typically this is done either in the form
   of demonstrating that the issue reported is not a problem after all, or more
   often, by opening a Pull Request.

### Submitting a Bug Report

When opening a new issue in the `Business Buddy` issue tracker, users will be
presented with a basic template that should be filled in.

```markdown
**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: [e.g. iOS]
 - Browser [e.g. chrome, safari]
 - Version [e.g. 22]

**Smartphone (please complete the following information):**
 - Device: [e.g. iPhone6]
 - OS: [e.g. iOS8.1]
 - Browser [e.g. stock browser, safari]
 - Version [e.g. 22]

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
```

If you believe that you have uncovered a bug in Business Buddy, please fill out this
form, following the template to the best of your ability. Do not worry if you
cannot answer every detail, just fill in what you can.

The two most important pieces of information we need in order to properly
evaluate the report is a description of the behavior you are seeing and a simple
test case we can use to recreate the problem on our own. If we cannot recreate
the issue, it becomes impossible for us to fix.

### Submitting a Feature Request

When opening a new feature request in the `Business Buddy` issue tracker, users will be
presented with a basic template that should be filled in.

```markdown
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.
```

If you believe that you have a good feature request for Business Buddy, please fill out this

cannot answer every detail, just fill in what you can.

The two most important pieces of information we need in order to properly
evaluate the report is a description of the problem you have identified,

### Resolving a Bug Report

In the vast majority of cases, issues are resolved by opening a Pull Request.
The process for opening and reviewing a Pull Request is similar to that of
opening and triaging issues, but carries with it a necessary review and approval
workflow that ensures that the proposed changes meet the minimal quality and
functional guidelines of Business Buddy.
