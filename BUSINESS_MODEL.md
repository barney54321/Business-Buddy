# Business Model

## Value Proposition

Our key value proposition is to supplement existing governmental communication channels and financial advisory services to help SMEs gain access to governmental fiscal relief programs and navigate the ever-changing regulatory requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic. This will not be limited to Australia, but to every other country in the world that needs to provide robust support to SMEs during these difficult times. 

Fundamentally, our platform is a model of how governmental services should be delivered. Instead of providing businesses and citizens with generic information, governments have to move towards a personalized and proactive communication model. Businesses and citizens should be able to gain access to all services relevant to their circumstances at their fingertips. Furthermore, they should be able to complete a transaction all on one platform, without having to be redirected or processed elsewhere. 

## Integration

Given this vision, it is necessary for Business Buddy to be integrated with governmental agencies. This will allow us to eventually facilitate an end-to-end customer journey for SMEs to apply for a grant on our platform, without ever having to leave the site. Furthermore, it will also provide the platform with a sense of legitimacy to increase user uptake. 

On this point, we have already entered into substantial discussion with state government representatives, gaining traction with this integration proposal. We next look towards discussion with the federal government to make this a nationwide initiative. This will provide a good entry point for us to begin negotiation with other state governments (given that state support also varies within Australia). 

## Customer Reach

### Australia

The most ideal scenario would be for us to be successful in our partnership with state and federal governments so that our platform can be displayed and accessed on official government websites. Currently, the Australian government has transformed its main page, Australia.gov.au, as a platform to deliver COVID-19 related information. We believe that our website can be well integrated into the webpage under a ‘Helping Australia’s Businesses’ section, to provide the one-stop-shop experience for SMEs. 

However, if a partnership with the government is not possible, we will seek a partnership with financial advisory providers so that our platform can act as a preliminary service offering to SMEs in determining their eligibility to grant and loan programs. Once Business Buddy is able to determine eligibility and advise on this issue, financial advisory providers can step in and assist the business with the actual application process, ensuring a smooth customer experience. 

In the scenario where we are unable to secure a partnership, we are still confident that we will be able to reach our customers through search engine optimisation, so that SMEs will see us as the first and go-to platform to address their grant and loan eligibility enquiries. 

### Internationally

As outlined in our project roadmap, we envision that our platform can eventually be adopted internationally. However, due to the increased level of operational risk, international expansion would only be implemented if we can secure a partnership and be integrated with foreign governmental entities. The first natural destination would be New Zealand given our close ties and proximity. Next, we look to expand this to the UK, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea if our model proves to be successful. 

## Financing and Future Revenue Source 

As a governmental support service, we hope to secure financing from the government to build out the model and to cover any ongoing administrative costs. This will be initiated after we continue our negotiation with state and federal governmental representatives.

If this is not successful, there are also other opportunities such as the MVP grant and Building Partnerships grant which we would likely be able to secure. For ongoing costs, we would then be able to meet this by introducing a subscription model with marginal fees to our users ($1-2). 

## Platform Maintenance 

Currently, the platform is being maintained by our team. We monitor whether there has been any additional fiscal relief programs that are being introduced by the government, and manually include this into our chatbot dialogue decision tree. This had to be done because web scraping did not prove to be very accurate as all the different governmental websites had different formatting structure, and secondly, our team had not been able to gain access to APIs to governmental websites. However, as discussed in the integration section, we believe that this may prove to be a temporary issue. Once we gain access to governmental API, our development team (hopefully with the support of IBM) can make the transition towards full integration so that eligibility requirements of the various grants can be automatically updated. 

## Data Ownership

Sensitive business information is securely stored in our database and is never shared to third party systems. To comply with domestic regulations, our data will also be stored within Australia. Lastly, we value the right to be ‘forgotten’ and include the functionality for users to delete all their information if they no longer want to use our service. 

As we expand into other countries and jurisdictions, we will endeavour to comply with local legal requirements and continue to uphold our principle of respect for user data ownership.
